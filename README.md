# LVLCodingSample
Coding sample request to gauge my ability to dive into technologies and libraries which are new to me for LVL Wellness

Database is from https://gist.github.com/mitch-keenan/bd2b6e3e2e364914c53e0ce623833042#:~:text=Chinook%20example%20test%20database

To build this project download it and then navigate to it on the command line.

Once there type "go get ."
Then "go run ."

After that the server should be running on a local host

From another command line window you can connect to it with the URL tracts/searchName where searchName is the searched for title

For example on windows the request might look like:

$curl http://localhost:4041/tracts/love
